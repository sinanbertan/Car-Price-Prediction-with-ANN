# CAR PRICE PREDICTION
- This repository contains the code and data for a project on Car Price Prediction. The project uses the merc.xlsx dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sinanbavli04/car-specs
## Installation
The following tools were used for this analysis:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Sklearn
- Tenserflow


- To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries by running the following command:


- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy plotly Sklearn tenserflow
    
## Usage 
- To run the analysis, simply execute the notebook. The script will generate several visualizations that help illustrate analysis of data.
## Roadmap

The analysis includes the following tasks:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- data visualization
- outlier detection 
- preprocessing 
- building model
- evaluating model
- visualization the results


The analysis includes visualizations using Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn.

## Contributing

- Contributions to this project are welcome. If you notice any errors or have ideas for additional analyses, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Conclusion 
* In This Project, I built a model of Car Price Prediction  with ANN algorithm. I have explored lots of insights by visualizing the dataset and I got precise result from model regression. According to my model, The R2  score is 0.79.
